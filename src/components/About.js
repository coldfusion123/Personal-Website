              Because I believe that by keeping things simple, I can emphasize
              details more, I attempt to do tasks as effectively as I can. I
              enjoy web programming, especially the front-end, and I can spend
              hours developing. I'm currently studying React.js, and I've
              already begun to set the groundwork for the following apps.{" "}
              <span>""</span>Everything is complicated because that's how we
              want it to be. Keep it simple!<span>""</span>
            </p>
